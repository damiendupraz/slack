List of changes to have the PHP script receiving messages from Slack, process the message and send back a response to Slack

1) change the http response code from 301 to 200 - the code 301 is for moved documents only
2) change the way the JSON message is read and decoded by PHP
3) add a json_encode before returning response to Slack during the challenge verification phase (url verification phase)
4) change the case when checking the user_change event - it was set to status_change but only user_change actually exists
5) change the path to access the real_name_normalized
6) removing TOKEN from the original payload
